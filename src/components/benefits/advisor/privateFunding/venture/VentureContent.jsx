								A venture capitalist (VC) is a private equity
								investor that provides capital to companies
								exhibiting high growth potential in exchange for
								an equity stake. This could be funding Startup
								ventures or supporting small companies that wish
								to expand but do not have access to equities
								markets.
								<br />
								<br />
								The typical venture capital investment occurs
								after an initial "seed funding" round. The first
								round of institutional venture capital to fund
								growth is called the Series A round.
